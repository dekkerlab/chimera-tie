In the itx2subset_strand.py script
1) Add headers to the output in the following format
    @gene_name_2	chr	strand	start_pos	length
    Header entries must be sorted by chr and position

2) Sort the output according to the following order:
   read_id, XX_1 , XX_2

3) in itx2matrix_strand.py
   change the scoring. Instead of giving interaction score to all of the nucleotides in the bins,
   give interaction scroe to the end nucleotides that are interacting.

   By considering XX and XY flags, we can distinguis loops from circularizations.

4) Remove exon-exon junctions.
This can be done by comparing the interaction file with a gtf annotation file containing
exon positions.
